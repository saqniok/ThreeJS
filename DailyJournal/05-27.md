# 🎯 Goal: Continue developing the visual part of the project using Three.js

## 🛠️ What I did today:
Worked with Three.js, rendering the scene in the browser.

Added a `for` loop intended to initialize the `positionsArray`.

After that — the page completely stopped loading.

## 🔍 Initial hypotheses:
Commented out the code — nothing changed.

Checked everything possible: refreshed, rebuilt, restarted the server — no result.

New hypothesis: maybe the issue is with the internet connection — GitHub wouldn’t upload files and just froze.

## ⚙️ What I did:
Checked internet speed — upload was only 0.1 Mbps.

### 📉 Started cleaning things up:

- Uninstalled unnecessary programs.
- Reset router settings.
- Flushed network configurations.

Result: upload speed jumped to 20 Mbps, but the project was still down.

- Reinstalled drivers.
- Disabled antivirus and firewalls.

Almost at the point of summoning shamans with drums… 🪘

## 🧠 Breakthrough:
Tested on another device — project still didn’t load.

Tried in another browser — still dead.

Finally, Firefox provided a hint: there's a delay in the code caused by this fragment:

```js
for (let i = 0; 0 < count * 3 * 3; i++) {
    positionsArray[i] = Math.random();
}

**I COMMENT OUT the code — the page is still dead.
I BRING BACK the code — the page crashes again.
7 HOURS wasted trying to understand that this was just an infinite loop with zero console errors.**

## ✅ Takeaways:
Even a small syntax bug (in this case, a wrong for loop condition) can create an infinite loop without any console warnings.

Commenting out problematic code doesn't always help immediately, since browsers can cache states or hold on to hanging processes.

Firefox turned out to be the savior by highlighting the delay.

🚨 Notes for the future:
Always double-check loop exit conditions.

Test on multiple devices and browsers.

Use console.log() in key spots to catch bugs faster.

Consider getting a ritual drum — just in case.
